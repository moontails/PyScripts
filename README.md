PyScripts
=========

A few simple python scripts that written by me for fun and learning. 

1. get_lyrics.py

This script will fetch the lyrics of a song. 

Usage - python get_lyrics.py "Song name" "artist name"

2. focussedcrawler.py

This script can be used to do focused crawling starting from a seed url.  It requires two textfiles - one containing the words from your corpus and the other containing other seed urls.

3. extract_and_construct.py

I wrote this script to parse and construct the img link. Will need tweaking to fit your html page.
